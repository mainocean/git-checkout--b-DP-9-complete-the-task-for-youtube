# Procedure creating resources, and how to display data sources
Hi! In this terraform code for YouTube video I create new projects called Resource Creation Procedure and also project Names. 

I practice pulling and displaying data sources in the console. This allows you to get information that you can use to configure your resources. Using data sources is a really powerful feature because it allows you to query your existing resources and use that information in your configurations. 

For example, dependon is great for controlling the order in which resources are created, ensuring that dependencies are properly managed. This will help you prioritize the resource you need and start it. I also extract data from aws availability zone, , aws regions, and aws instances, and etc.
